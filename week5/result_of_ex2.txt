From the experiment I can see that the difference between 2 function(RTC and Delay)
The result is it isn't equal. In my conclusion I conclude that the delay function is a bit delay
from what RTC function give me. From the start it might look like it's equal but later on I can see the difference very clearly.
I can see 2 caused here

1.The counting - The time from RTC and time from delay might have different calculating way so that 
caused the gap betweem those two function. At frst it might not be obvious because the gap is very small
but it raisee the gap higher after some times, then at that moment the gap became more clear.
2.Human error - Since I used myself to count and press the time from stopwatch. I can't press the time to 
exactly match the time from the computer. At first the time gap is very small but at the nearly end those gap 
became bigger. So that's why I conclude human error too.
